# Functional_Programming_Python
This is created to learn more about functional Programming in Python inspired from 
this [blog post] (www.bogotobogo.com/python/python_fncs_map_filter_reduce.php).

To understand the intricacies of how these built in methods works, I have replicated their core implementation
using basic Python loops and lists. These built-in methods are optimized so even if we can get our work done using
core implementations everytime but we can't get optimized results using our code. So, it's better to use built-ins :)

**List of things learnt :**
- [x] map
- [x] reduce
- [x] filter
- [x] lambda

**TODO**:
Still lots of things to learn from [Python documentation] (https://docs.python.org/3.5/howto/functional.html).
- [ ] generators
- [ ] Iterators
- [ ] zip/enumerate
- [ ] itertools
- [ ] functools

*Insight* : I feel that the course on functional programming about how lambda function actually works and centres about expressions gave me more insights in getting the feel of inbuilt lambda functions which had always been a daunting factor for me.
